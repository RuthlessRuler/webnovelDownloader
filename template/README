You can Modify the the CSS if you want.

For Introduction and Credits, use html based Code. But, You dont need to type <html>....<body> etc.
This is due to the fact the conents will be placed directly inside the body tag, so just sue the rest of the tags like  p, br , a, table, ol/ul.

Eg.
<p> A story where MC becomes legend. </p>
